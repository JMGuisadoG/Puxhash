GUI for computing SHA1 and MD5 hashes for files in Windows. Completely free as in freedom.

So... basically I was tired of struggling to find free software to compute SHA1 and MD5 on Windows >7 so I came up with this simple tool.

_Friendly disclaimer:_ This tool was created in under 15 minutes so please keep that in mind.
